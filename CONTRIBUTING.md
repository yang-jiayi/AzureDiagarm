## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use the [GitHub Issues](../../issues) tab to report bugs or suggest features.
- Search existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Include as much detail as possible: steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, screenshots, browser/OS info.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure your code follows the existing coding style (TypeScript, React conventions).
4. Make sure the project builds successfully (`npm run build`).
5. Write a clear PR description explaining your changes.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AzureDiagarm.git
cd AzureDiagarm

# Install dependencies
npm ci
npm --prefix server ci
npm --prefix mcp-server ci

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local configuration. Never commit credentials.

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Validation

Run the checks that cover the area you changed. Before opening a pull request,
the complete validation set is:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
npm --prefix server test
npm --prefix mcp-server test
npm run test:e2e
```

### Coding Guidelines

- **Language**: TypeScript with React 18
- **Styling**: Component-level `.css` files
