# Application Insights KQL Queries

KQL queries for analyzing telemetry from the Microsoft Product Architecture Diagram Builder app via `aq-app-insights-001`.

---

## 1. Custom Events Summary (by Event Name)

Returns all custom event types with active users, unique sessions, and total instances.

```kql
customEvents
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| summarize
    ActiveUsers = dcount(user_Id),
    UniqueSessions = dcount(session_Id),
    TotalInstances = count()
  by name
| order by TotalInstances desc
```

> Adjust `ago(24h)` to match the desired time range (e.g., `ago(7d)`, `ago(30d)`).

---

## 2. Custom Events Summary (Grouped by App Name)

Same as above but grouped under the application name, matching the Active Users blade layout.

```kql
customEvents
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| summarize
    ActiveUsers = dcount(user_Id),
    UniqueSessions = dcount(session_Id),
    TotalInstances = count()
  by appName, name
| order by appName, TotalInstances desc
```
